    "### 1. I used a dataset from Kaggle with texts from three different authors: Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft, and Mary Shelley, or EAP, HPL, and MWS, respectively.\n",
    "### 2. I took two columns from the dataset: author and text, and I used the train_test_split function to split the data into training and testing sets\n",
    "### 3. I used a Natural Language Text Processing model, called Bag-Of-Words, to classify each author.\n",
    "### 4. I transformed the data into a format that the Naive-Bayes MultinomialNB model would accept.\n",
    "### 5. I trained and preidicted the model, then calclated accuracy using the F1-Score metric.\n",
    "### 6. Since the model had a passable score, I then copied and pasted a line from Edgar Allan Poe's short story, \"Ligeia\". I used the trained model to classify the text.\n",
    "### 7. The model correctly classified the short text, and I printed out the author of the text."

Yet I believe that I met her first and most frequently in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her family --I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word alone --by Ligeia --that I bring before mine eyes in fancy the image of her who is no more. \n",
